Sample Chrome Extensions
===========================

To install,

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser
2. Check the `Developer Mode` checkbox
3. Load any of these sample extensions as an "unpacked" extension. Hint: when the file browser dialog
pops up, you want to select the folder, not a specific file.

###Examples
1. Kittens! -- adds a little toolbar button that fetches a kitten photo for you
2. Harlem Shake -- makes pages which contain the word 'Harlem' do the Harlem shake
3. Harlem Shake 2 -- same thing as above, but with page actions.
4. Tutorial -- slides from the presentation.
